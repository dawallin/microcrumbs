{"name":"Microcrumbs","tagline":"An Interactor Tracing Framework for .Net","body":"Microcrumbs\r\n===================\r\n\r\nMicrocrumbs is an open source, interactor tracing framework for .Net. \r\n\r\n###What is an interactor tracing framework?\r\nIn the world of microservices, responsibilities are broken down into small individual pieces, loosely coupled often connected first at runtime. The connection could be an event where the publisher is even unaware of who is subscribing. \r\n>An **interactor tracing framework** binds together what started an interaction and which actors that were involved.\r\n\r\n###End-to-End tracing\r\nThe interactor tracing data can then be sent to a centralized collector. From there it can then be used for monitoring, querying or analysing in end-to-end tracing tools like [Zipkin](https://twitter.github.io/zipkin/),  [PinPoint](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint) or [Phosphor](https://github.com/mattheath/phosphor). All these are based on the technique from the Google [Dapper project](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html).\r\n\r\n### Unix philosophy\r\n>**The Unix philosophy:** \r\nWrite programs that do one thing and do it well.\r\n\r\nMicrocrumbs adhere to the Unix Philosophy (\"Write programs that do one thing and do it well.\"), and is specialiced in only one thing, gathering interaction data. Analysis and presentaion is left for other projects.\r\n","google":"UA-61417328-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
